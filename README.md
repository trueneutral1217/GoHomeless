# GoHomeless

This is the current version of Go Homeless!  The local repo file directory was different from the github repo, 
so if you want older info about this project, check go homelessbaddirectories.  I'll delete that repo eventually.

7/21/22 - removed FPS from main screen, stopped running if statements for media loading, removed some artifacts,
and generally tried to reduce the size (in lines) of main.cpp.
